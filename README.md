that development has slowed down.
My test homework to interview with several task. Task first and second contain work with pandas and sqlite3 db. Task three contains app that was created with django(testapp does not done at this moment) .

## Installation
It`s a test work without installation. Only some scripts in here.

``` python 
db_connect.py: returns a created data base with sqlite3 from csv file which was taken with the test tasks.
